# Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

npm i

# Compilation (you may skip)

To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript, use the TypeScript compiler (tsc). Run the following command:

npx tsc


# Running the Game

To run the game, you may encounter errors after running the `npx tsc` command regarding some imports for Pixi and GSAP. However, the game will still run!

To serve the game files, you can use a live server. If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the Live Server extension.

1. Install Live Server as a Visual Studio Code extension.
2. Navigate to the `dist` folder.
3. Right-click on the `index.html` file.
4. Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.

This will automatically open your default web browser and run the VaultGame.
